# Juniors Spring Intensive Deliverable Proposal

## TODO: copy this file, fill it out, and push it up to your project's repo.

Dates 3/16-3/25

**My Name:** 
Andre Williams

**Project Name:**

Startup Predictor


**Is your project New or Old?**
New

**Is your project Solo or Team?**
Solo

## Description
Startup Predictor is a tool for venture capitalist and angel investors to make better decisions when deciding on what startups to invest in based off of the history of successful and unsuccessful companies. 

**Write a paragraph summary of the current status of your project, what you hope to achieve during the intensive, how and why**
I have not started the project; however, I'm optomistic about what I can achieve within a week. I hope to achieve building a multiple linear regression machine learning model and a simple flask application that loads the model and is available to users.

## Challenges I Anticipate
A challenge that I anticipate would be setting up a database for authentication and setting up a paywall on heroku.


**List out the challenges you anticipate for completing this project**
- machine learning model
- Finding a dataset
- Paywall 
- Productionized database 
- User Authentication 

## Skateboard

**ONE SINGLE aspect of product. Consider: build backend for SPD 1.2 front end, CRUD one resource, use API or library, authentication etc.**

Build the flask route that takes in data from a form.

**Start coding and finish “Skateboard” feature before beginning “Bike”.** 

## Bike
**ONE additional features that get you closer to your idealized product. Examples: CRUD 2nd resource, add comments, API use, authentication, library use** 
Build machine learning model that predicts the ROI of a startup

## Car
**ONE additional feature** 
Build a database for user authentication 

## Personal Achievement Goals:

**Each teammate must achieve 2 of 3 of their self-set personal achievement goals. If you're not on a team, delete the other teammate sections as needed.**

### Teammate 1 Goals

1. Host on Google Cloud
2. Build a machine learning model
3. Integrate a live database
