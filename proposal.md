# Juniors Spring Intensive Deliverable Proposal

## TODO: copy this file, fill it out, and push it up to your project's repo.

Dates 3/16-3/25

**My Name:** 
Andre Williams

**Project Name:**

Startup ROI Predictor


**Is your project New or Old?**
New

**Is your project Solo or Team?**
Solo

## Description
Startup Predictor is a tool for venture capitalist and angel investors to make better decisions when deciding on what startups to invest in based off of the history of successful and unsuccessful companies. 

**Write a paragraph summary of the current status of your project, what you hope to achieve during the intensive, how and why**
I have not started the project; however, I'm optomistic about what I can achieve within a week. I hope to achieve building a multiple linear regression machine learning model and a simple flask application that loads the model and is available to users.

## Challenges I Anticipate
A challenge that I anticipate would be setting up a database for authentication and setting up a paywall on heroku.


**List out the challenges you anticipate for completing this project**
- machine learning model: multiple linear regression
- Finding a dataset
- Paywall 
- Productionized database 
- User Authentication 

## Skateboard

- Build a basic flask application that takes in inputs for the amount of money an investor would like to spend on a startup and then provide a positive or negative ROI given what the company location and what parts of the company they invested in. The dataset I will start with is a kaggle dataset that shows a history of the amount of money and profit startups made with these columns: Marketing, RnD, Administration, Location and then their overall profit. The application will not yet provide a time frame and will not cover the funding the startup recieved to provide a prediction of the company's success. The investor should be able to type in the amount of money they want to invest in each part of the startup and provide the location of the startup in the form. Then I will provide an overall prediction based on these metrics if the startup is profitable.

**Start coding and finish “Skateboard” feature before beginning “Bike”.** 

## Bike
**ONE additional features that get you closer to your idealized product. Examples: CRUD 2nd resource, add comments, API use, authentication, library use** 
- Do extensive data analysis on the dataset to answer questions like where are the most profitable startups located. Which part of the company needs the investment to be successful? I will use pandas, numpy, scipy, and seaborn for this data and statistical analysis.

## Car
**ONE additional feature** 
- Find a larger that dataset with more features by querying an API for more information on startups. This will provide more detailed information on the years the startup has been alive, series of funding, the industry the startup is in ect. Then learn how to apply multiple linear regression to make a prediction on the ROI for the VC. 

## Personal Achievement Goals:

**Each teammate must achieve 2 of 3 of their self-set personal achievement goals. If you're not on a team, delete the other teammate sections as needed.**

### Teammate 1 Goals

1. Host in the cloud 
2. Learn Multiple Linear Regression
3. Integrate a live database
4. Query an API for the data
